I am an Assistant Professor in the
[Department of Zoology](http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/) and [Biodiversity
Research Centre](http://www.biodiversity.ubc.ca) at the University of
British Columbia in beautiful Vancouver, Canada. I use computational approaches to understand large-scale patterns of biodiversity and the evolutionary and ecological processes that generate them.
