I am currently an Associate Professor (Senior Lecturer) working in the [Plant Ecology and Evolution Section](https://www.ieg.uu.se/plant/) at Uppsala University in Uppsala, Sweden.  Previously, I was an NSF International Postdoctoral Fellow splitting time between the [Ecoinformatics & Biodiversity section](http://bios.au.dk/en/about-bioscience/organisation/ecoinformatics-and-biodiversity/) Aarhus University in Denmark and the [Forest Ecology and Management](http://www.wageningenur.nl/en/Expertise-Services/Chair-groups/Environmental-Sciences/Forest-Ecology-and-Forest-Management-Group.htm) at Wageningen University in the Netherlands.
