I am currently a postdoctoral researcher working in [Ecoinformatics and Biodiversity](http://bios.au.dk/en/about-bioscience/organisation/ecoinformatics-and-biodiversity/) at Aarhus University in Denmark.  Previously, I was an NSF International Postdoctoral Fellow splitting time between Aarhus University and the [Forest Ecology and Management](http://www.wageningenur.nl/en/Expertise-Services/Chair-groups/Environmental-Sciences/Forest-Ecology-and-Forest-Management-Group.htm) at Wageningen University in the Netherlands.
